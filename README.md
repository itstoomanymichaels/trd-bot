# trd-bot

This is a first iteration of a trading bot that I'll develop.
It will use a simple strategy, once a breakout occurs in either direction, a buy indicator
will be used to get a position, along with a trailing stop loss. Once the stop
loss is hit, a sell indicator will be used to close the position. Simple enough
strat, will provide updates somewhere, haven't decided where yet.
